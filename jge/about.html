		<p>
			I created this site because I have a dream. A dream that the days of the SCI-FI MMO are far from over.
			A dream that JGE might be what we've all been waiting for. Oh yes, I have a dream.
			Ever since the golden years of Anarchy Online were over, the thirst, nay, the <em>hunger</em> for something new has kept us all searching.
			Here's hoping it's finally here, in <a href="http://www.jumpgateevolution.com">Jumpgate Evolution</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Apart from serving as a hub for news and rumours, this site will contain (what yours truly considers) essential information.
			This information will be presented in a manner first and foremost suited for the experienced MMO gamer. 
			Thus the tagline <em>"Jumpgate Evolution Pro Resource"</em>.
			I don't have anything against nubs, but I aim to cater to people who've been playing MMO's for a while.
			Mainly because that means I can write less and link up theorycraft without explaining what it is.
			Do you feel me?
		</p>

		<p>
			At the time of writing this the game hasn't even entered closed beta yet.
			Obviously the content of the site will be sparse until I have gotten my hands on a copy and, gasp, played for a few hours.
			I do hope, however, that you enjoy what little content there is. Send me tips on <a href="http://twitter.com/binaerpilot">Twitter</a>, thanks.

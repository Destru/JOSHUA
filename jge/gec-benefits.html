		<h1>Corporation rules</h1>
		<p>
			We believe the fewer rules the better, however the need for them is apparent in any organized entity.
			Observe the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is not a democracy; It is a military dictatorship</li>
			<li>Keep comms clear of static during high-pressure operations</li>
			<li>Charging GEC members for anything is <span class="u">not</span> allowed</li>
			<li>Malicious drama will not be tolerated regardless of skill</li>
		</ul>

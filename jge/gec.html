		<h1>GEC Jumpgate Squadron</h1>

		<p>
			After having revolutionized the robotics industry, and subsequently dooming all of mankind,
			the GEC decided it was time to perfect interstellar travel.
			Thanks to the previous experiments in <a href="http://binaerpilot.no/blog/2008/07/planet-takers.html" title="Planet Takers">bending light</a>,
			a series of craft equipped with a new prototype engine were quickly produced.
			An elite group of pilots from <a href="http://binaerpilot.no/blog/2009/04/battlestar-ii.html" title="Battlestar II">the battlestar</a> were hand-picked to aid with the testing,
			but during the first orbital test flight something went horribly awry and the whole squadron was sucked up by this weird space phenomena (wobbly looking thing).

		<p>
			Shocked and disoriented, our band of heroes suddenly found themselves in Solrain space.
			With nothing but their wit, a handful of laser turrets and their balls.
			Balls of such immense magnitude, the Solrain gave them anything they wanted in exchange for their allegiance.
			Now, working as mercenaries of Solrain, our heroes are the toughest of the tough, the coolest of the cool and in possession of ridiculously large testicles.
			Testicles is another word for balls.

		<h2>Humanized Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The GEC started out as group of Norwegian gamers united by a shared love for <a href="http://binaerpilot.no" title="Cool Electro Music">Bin√§rpilot</a>, computer games, science fiction and straight up murdering people online.
			Since then we've become more inclusive and invited foreigners to join us in our alcohol-fueled killing sprees.
			We're picky about our members (and thus not a large corporation), but our shared PvP experience dictates we will be a force to be reckoned with in territorial warfare.
			And even though we're all for cheap laughs, at the end of the day what counts is the kill-count.
			<em>Semper Ebrius</em>.

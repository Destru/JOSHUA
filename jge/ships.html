		<h2>Observations</h2>
		<p>
			From what I've seen of the ship models so far, these concepts are more than indicative of the final designs.
			Based on this I conclude that Octavius will have the coolest looking ships, with Quantar a close second. You don't agree? Fine, but you're obviously wrong.
			Oh how I love making my own websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			My faction of choice, Solrain, unfortunately looks like they will have the worst ships. Which is a shame, because it initially looked like they would
			have hard, clean lines. But instead they look rather clumsily put together. Or like they started out nice and clean, but made out of plastic and held over a flame a few seconds.
			Yeah, that's it, something is wrong with the curves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quantar is really bad ass, and if I wasn't such a fan of Italian car design (with added Japanese flair), they might have knocked Octavius for the 1st place.
			They will also supposedly be the fastest ships around, which might make me forego my planned Solrain allegiance in favor of Quantar.
			Only problem? The Quantar are spiritual beings in the lore. You know, they believe in a supreme being and all that inane bullshit.
			Might be a tough sell.

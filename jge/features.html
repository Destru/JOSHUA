	<h1>Features</h1>
		<p>Let's try to cut through the usual marketing department-BS with the feature list.</p>

			Jumpgate Evolution offers a unique twitch-based combat system which allows you to challenge thousands of foes with your own skill and determination, offering the most exhilarating, jaw-dropping experience in online gaming to date.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the adjectives aside, this really is the single most important thing to consider when it comes to JGE: <span class="u">Twich-based combat</span>.
			Yes boys and girls, this mean that we will again see some real combat in an MMO (RIP Tabula Rasa).
			You have to actually aim at targets. And there is no GCD to synchronize things, combat is actual real-time.
			How this will pan out in terms of potential network issues remains to be seen (let's hope the technology behind is solid),
			but this feature alone is enough to get any MMO gamer's panties wet.

			Each jump will take you to exotic new locations with exciting new adventures. The universe is a vast and dangerous place and as old threats never die you’d be wise to remember this. Pirates, brigands, and opposing faction members are just some of the dangers present in the Jumpgate universe. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Personally I strongly suspect the universe is not as vast as this text leads you to believe.
			MMO's like AO and EVE have set the standard when it comes to size and I highly doubt JGE will come close to rivaling either.
			That's not to say it won't expand continuously, but at launch...

			Although graphically stunning, Jumpgate is highly scaleable, allowing the game to run flawlessly on low end PCs. Jumpgate also offers joystick and peripheral support, adding to the immersive online experience.

			Become a pilot for any of the three playable nations. Join the corrupt, power-hungry Solrain, the disciplined, combat ready Octavian or the spiritually-led Quantar.

		<p>Octavian the good, Solrain the evil and Quantar the weird.</p>

			Jumpgate Evolution offers limitless game play and content with a unique mission generator capable of generating thousands of fresh and immersive missions for players to embark on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Judging from experience, this means that there will be a limited pool of worthwhile quests at launch. Random mission generators have a tendency to suck.
			To put it another way, when describing previous attempts at pulling this off, "immersive" would be the last thing to spring to mind.
			But then again, we're here for the pew pew!

			Players are given ultimate power as Jumpgate offers a fully immersive player driven economy. Protect a merchant vessel on its trade route by intercepting enemy players or answer a battle stations call for help by delivering them much needed supplies.
		</p>
		<p>
			As long as there is a functioning trade-system in place, I for one will be more than happy.
			It's a relief to read that they're listing it as a feature, that probably means it has been important from the beginning.
			(As opposed to several MMO's of late who launched without a decent system for trading.)

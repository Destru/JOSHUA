<p>Awful. Another porno movie <strong>without</strong> any actual porn. The CGI is actually half-decent (at least it was in the beginning), but everything else looks put together by toddlers with Down syndrome. Disregarding the actor who forgot to remove his retainer, my biggest gripe with this movie is the sound design. Every pivotal scene that has an outburst also has, drum roll, an elaborate echo-effect.</p>

<p>God this is bad. Rachael is crying. The so-called robots make scary Jurassic Park-noises every now and then, undoubtedly to add to the suspense. I say robots, but basically it's just this one dude beating up the entire planet. He's emotional for a robot, pounding one guy into a bloody pulp for five minutes. I'm guessing he's not their most efficient model.</p>

<p>Not even going to finish this one. The people are panting, all the time, and they run, and they scream, with added echo. This movie smells like a five-hundred pound kebab waitress who just finished running the New York marathon. Fuck this noise.</p>

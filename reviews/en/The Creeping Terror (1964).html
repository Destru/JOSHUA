<p>Crap noir featuring the most uninspired couch-looking sci-fi monster ever.
It's not even remotely scary. People go fucking nuts over this hump of cloth, I don't understand.
At least if it had like some fucking teeth, or some claws, or <span class="underline">something</span>.
But nooo... It's like three people walking underneath carrying this chinese parade-reject, pulling other people into it. Boo fucking hoo I'm so scawed.</p>

<p class="irc">
alexander: what the fuck is that supposed to be? is that the spaceship? that's the worst fucking alien I have ever seen...<br />
steffen: a Jabba the Hut prototype<br />
alexander: Jabba teh Suck</p>

<p>Inge hasn't been paying attention, so he gets a recap. The alien keeps making these noises, like radio static.
It's driving me insane.</p>

<p class="irc">
alexander: just wait 'till you see the alien<br />
alexander: whatever it is it appears to be broadcasting CBS<br />
alexander: and it doesn't have hands but the ship is filled with knobs<br />
steffen: nice how the victims have to help the monster in eating</p>

<p>We discover disturbing things about our mutual friend Steffen.</p>

<p class="irc">
steffen: breast feeding rules<br />
steffen: or, just breast ^_^</p>

<p>Nothing fucking happens yo.</p>

<p class="irc">
alexander: we should make a petition for plot<br />
steffen: they used all the money on the monster instead of plot<br />
alexander: "bobby's hopelessly inbred synapses slowly begin to fire"<br />
alexander: they sure knew how to dance back then<br />
steffen: by "dance" you mean "make a fool out of oneself"<br />
inge: man, look at him go, he's got the moves<br />
alexander: he's got the motion<br />
alexander: oh my god, look at that ass go<br />
alexander: black girls in rap videos eat your hearts out<br />
steffen: shake your booty, woo<br />
</p>

<p>The monstarr disrupts the party in the gym.</p>

<p class="irc">
alexander: how the hell did the, let's call it "monster", ever manage to get out of that little hole in the,
let's call it "ship"<br />
inge: through sheer willpower<br />
inge: we need to do screengrabs of this monster for the site, it's humping the car<br />
alexander: I didn't notice it actually had two tiny feet 'till now</p>

<p>Piece of shit movie. Suddenly there's two monsters. One gets run over by a car. Finally some redneck
fucktit managed to figure out how to operate an automobile and direct it's force towards the chinese sofa.
I don't remember how the monsters evil twin (or whatever) died. Safe to say it was probably dumb as fuck.</p>

<p class="irc">
alexander: please someone just shoot at it<br />
alexander: it's eaten half the town you moron, for fuck's sake, end this travesty<br />
alexander: I've been waiting for over an hour to see that monster die, and now there's another one</p>

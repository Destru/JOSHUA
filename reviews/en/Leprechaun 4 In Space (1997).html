<p>I sat through it. All horrible 87 minutes of it. It's the worst movie monster, the worst actors, the worst script, the worst everything.
I can safely say I regret it wholeheartedly. A more ungratifying experience is hard to find.
There is absolutely nothing of value here. </p>

<p>I'd demand my money back but luckily I wasn't dumb enough to pay anything to watch this piece of shit.</p>

<p>God suck it down. Seriously fucking get down and suck. AAAAAH! I hate this FUCKING piece of shit movie. I hate the director.
Yeah you. Fuck you. Fucking cock. I want to write you a letter; Dear fucking cuntfaced director-prick.
You cocklicking whorish spermsucking son of a bitch. I hope you suffer the most agonozing and foul death ever bestowed
upon any mortal being. Nuns will defecate on your grave for all of eternity. You fucking musical-fan.</p>

<p>I'll kill anyone who willingly admits to participating in this movie.
With my hidden talent for telekinesis. Blow heads up Scanners-style, through sheer willpower.
This is mind-blowingly horrible shit. Fucking avoid at all costs. If any children read this go wash your ears out with soap.
And prey you never get as foul a mouth as me. Mom if you're reading this I am very sorry.
I apologize. I'll never do it again.</p>

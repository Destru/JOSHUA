<p>A In terms of uttered wordage in the log-file, this comes dead last.
Unfortunately, that's not because we enjoyed ourselves.
This movie is complete and utter shite.

<p class="irc">
inge: this is an ed wood flick, i forgot to mention it.<br />
alexandr: a true classic in other words<br />
inge: right.</p>

<p>Yeah sure, my old self, if by <em>classic</em> you mean <em>crime against film</em>.
It's a waste of bandwith. Don't bother.</p>

<p class="irc">
inge: this movie has no redeeming qualities, whatsoever<br />
alexandr: ooo, tits<br />
inge: i take back my statement</p>

<p>Now you know where the star comes from. Tits good.</p>

I actually managed to find the first <em>Bring It On</em> movie somewhat entertaining.
It had good actors, well some... Well, one... Anyway, it had a decent script and an overall sense of <em>fun</em> to it.
Like the director went: "We all know this is not exactly a <em>Godfather</em> in the making, so let's just have fun with it."
And it worked.</p>

<p>This movie however, is an entirely different story.
If it was possible for vomit to pass through ear-canals I am certain there would have been residue
on my shoulders after watching this atrocity. This is not a movie.
This is a torture device constructed by ex-nazi scientists in a desperate attempt
to leviate some of their sexual frustration in these metrosexual times.

The only reason this movie gets one star... Is something I am trying to remember while writing this...
Actually I don't recall anything of interest in this piece of shit. No wait!
There's a locker-room scene.

<p>What is it with the people working in the american movie industry that makes them come up with
mindless, stereotypical horseshit such as this? I don't know.
What I do know is movie right from the start gave me bad sense of foreboding in my stomach;
Like you've just eaten a healthy portion of really, really, <em>really</em> bad meat.</p>

<p>
Now you're sitting there, starting to sweat, thinking you might be coming down with the flu.
Blissfully unaware that you'll be spending the next couple of hours praying face down to some porcelain god,
begging for his mercy, begging for a mere second of relief from this horrible pain...
This movie is exactly like that.

alexander: I saw the day after tomorrow yesterday<br />
alexander: holy shit was it a piece of crap<br />
alexander: I'm writing a poop-review for it now<br />
rachael: OMG! that's soo funny!<br />
rachael: i saw that in the theaters, and at the end i stood up and clapped<br />
rachael: it was sooo horrible<br />
alexander: yeah, what a pointless movie<br />
rachael: the fucking wolves<br />
rachael: that was the dumbest shit i've ever seen<br />
alexander: hilariously bad<br />
rachael: why jake? whyy?

<p>There's five billion people starring in this movie.
During the movie we get to know none of them.
I can sum up the entire film in three lines:
Suddenly there's a new Ice Age. Suddenly there's not anymore.
End movie.

<p>One star for the FX-team. If it wasn't for the "Timber Wolves 2000 Ultra Killer Squad"
I'd give two (they looked more like something out of Fangoria than wolves).</p>

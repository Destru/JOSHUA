<p>Not technically a poop-session, but after I saw it, I was never in doubt that it belonged here.
What a piece of shit movie. Everybody has been talking about it. <em>"Real sex scenes"</em> blabla.
<em>"Provoking movie"</em> horseshit. </em>"From the guy who made <em>Kids"</em> like that's the hallmark of quality.</p>
<p>
I enjoyed <em>Kids</em>, but this movie was a huge windup for nothing. It doesn't even make sense.
<em>"But it really has something to say."</em> Haha, are you high? About what? It only provokes for the sake of provoking.
Tell me how essential for the movie the threesome was? Oh yeah, let's just suddenly cut to three teens
having sex with each other, that's what people came to see anway.</p>

<p>What a steaming hot pile of trash this is. If I wanted to see porno I'd download it at <a href="http://www.empornium.us">Empornium</a> (hi guys!),
thanks for caring. When I watch film I want something with more substance, actually. Try saying that
without sounding snotty. But it's true. This movie manages to completely ruin the good impression that
guy left me with after Kids. How can you go from making that instant classic to this fucking dribble?</p>

<p>Huge spoiler alert ahead. Stop reading now if you care, I don't. Ken Park is this fucking skaterkid who
kills himself in the beginning. Then you sit through this whole film of teens fucking with added, stupendously boring, dialogue.
At the end you find out the reason he killed himself is because his girlfriend is pregnant and wants to keep it.
<em>Blow me.</em></p>

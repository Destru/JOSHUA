With absolutely zero anticipation, watching this movie was a complete and utter blast.
This is some of the most inventive and funny comedy I've seen in a long while.
It features ninja cheerleaders with nice tits, evil catholic schoolgirl ninjas of some sort, also bearing nice tits.
A porn star, a bunch of trekkies, a writer that actually is funny and your regular assortment of freaks and geeks.
This is one kick-ass flick that I'd love seing again. I actually saw it twice.</p>

<p>
At first we started out trying to warm up for the trashing but soon realized
this was no ordinary <em>no budget to speak of</em>-movie.
The acting was shit, but it had it's charms.
The dialogue was adolescent dribble at best, but it worked.
The characters were stereotypical, perverted and vulgar.
So naturally we started thinking <em>"Hey, this might not be so shit."</em>
And it wasn't. I laughed my ass off.

alexandr: ahahahaaha<br />
inge: these are the worst ninjas ever<br />
inge: but +1 for the panties shot<br />
alexandr: hamster cam pwns<br />
alexandr: AHAHAHAHAHAAHA</p>

<p>So great, this movie was, that we completely forgot about actually writing down comments.
The logfile is probably the smallest for a POOP-session ever.
If I'm to judge by that this is probably the most enjoyable POOP experience so far.

alexandr: omg yes!<br />
inge: lol @ unbuttoning<br />
alexandr: AHAHHAAHAHAH<br />
alexandr: omfgomfogmogmfomfofg<br />
inge: i'm dying<br />
inge: DYING</p>

<p>And they laughed their heads off all the way through the night.
Favorite scene: It's either the <em>American Beauty</em>-spoof or
when the two monsters battle it out using gigantic rubber dildos while being cheered on by bystanders.
You can't put a pricetag on that.</p>
